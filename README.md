# Description

This repository contains solutions to exercices provided by the course LEPL1503 - Projet 3 @ UCLouvain

I do *NOT* recommend to use these solutions only to clear the exercices.

These solutions are only provided to unlock you if you're really blocked in an exercice and you don't see how to solve it.

You should always try the exercices by yourself and understand how the code works instead of just copying the answers, this is your responsability as a student, not mine.

# Compilation : 

To compile a C code into an executable :

``` bash
make <src_filename>

ex : make week2    // create the executable week2 from src/week2.c
```

# Run 

 You can run the files from the exe directory after compiling it
 
# File organization

```bash
|
|-- bash_code                     : exercices about shell manipulation
|-- exe                           : directory containing the executables files
|-- makefile_exercice             : directory containing the exercice about modules in C
|-- src                           : directory containing the C source code
|-- supp                          : bonus exercices (about bit_manipulation)
|-- test                          : directory to test code
|-- Makefile                      : generate files
```
